Here's what works to set up a local branch that tracks an existing
remote branch. First

git remote show origin

shows what remote branches there are. Then

git checkout --track origin/<remote branchName>

EXAMPLE:

git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:Macaulay2/Workshop-2024-Utah.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:Macaulay2/Workshop-2024-Utah.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    CYTools        tracked
    DbCY           tracked
    GLInvariants   tracked
    NumberFields   tracked
    Radical        tracked
    RuledSurfaces  tracked
    ToricVarieties tracked
    Varieties      tracked
    main           tracked
    practice       tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    main merges with remote main
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    main pushes to main (up to date)
hippo-457:Workshop-2024-Utah de1$ git checkout --track origin/Radical
branch 'Radical' set up to track 'origin/Radical'.
